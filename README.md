## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a predictive model for car prices using machine learning techniques. This can help in understanding the factors that affect car prices and assist in making informed decisions when buying or selling cars.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various features of cars such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. The target variable is the price of the car.

### Source

- [Kaggle Car Price Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- Preprocessing steps and feature engineering details can be found in the Jupyter notebooks provided in the repository.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git
cd car-price-prediction
```

### Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Follow these steps to train and evaluate the model.

### Data Preparation

Ensure that the dataset is in the correct directory. If using the default dataset, place it in the `data/` folder.

### Training the Model

You can train the model using the provided Jupyter notebooks or the Python script:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

### Making Predictions

To make predictions on new data, use the prediction script:

```bash
python predict.py --input data/new_car_data.csv --output predictions.csv
```

## Model Details

The model used is a Random Forest Re

ressor, chosen for its robustness and ability to handle non-linear relationships. Key steps in the model development process include:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and erroneous data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
- **Model Training**: Training the Random Forest model using cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Details of these steps can be found in the `notebooks/` directory, which contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model training notebooks.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R-squared (RÂ²) Score**

The evaluation results are documented in the `evaluation/` folder, including comparison with baseline models.
